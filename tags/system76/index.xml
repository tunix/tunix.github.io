      <description>I was using mostly Mac computers from companies I worked for for a long time. Frankly, I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember the last time I had my own computer, when and for how much I sold it.
There was a time when we built our own desktop computers and computer prices were reasonable. Macs were still expensive, but computer prices were never out of reach . I&amp;rsquo;m seriously worried about the prices we have nowadays.</description>

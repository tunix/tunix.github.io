      <description>I was using mostly Mac computers from companies I worked for for a long time. Frankly, I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember the last time I had my own computer, when and for how much I sold it.
There was a time when we built our own desktop computers and computer prices were reasonable. Macs were still expensive, but computer prices were never out of reach . I&amp;rsquo;m seriously worried about the prices we have nowadays.</description>

      <description>Hello World! ðŸ™‚
As with the common tradition of programming languages, I wanted to start by writing &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo; as I started my new journey with this site. Despite how much I liked the UX of it, I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself but to hate Medium&amp;rsquo;s current approach of hiding everything behind a paywall and annoy me with popups etc. Also I hated 2 things since the beginning:
Placing all my comments around Medium as new stories I&amp;rsquo;ve shared &amp;ndash; most of my comments aren&amp;rsquo;t really as constructive as I&amp;rsquo;d think of a &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo;</description>
